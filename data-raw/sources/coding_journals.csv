1,International Organization,1947,Cambridge University Press,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization,"International Organization is a leading peer-reviewed journal that covers the entire field of international affairs. Subject areas include: foreign policies, international relations, international and comparative political economy, security policies, environmental disputes and resolutions, European integration, alliance patterns and war, bargaining and conflict resolution, economic development and adjustment, and international capital movements. A study that does not emphasize any international (or cross-border) phenomenon as a major cause or effect falls outside the journal’s domain. IO features articles that contribute in some way to the improvement of general knowledge or empirical theory defined broadly. Although we may publish a manuscript designed to propose a solution to a current world problem, we prefer to publish those that also apply theoretical ideas, contribute empirical analyses or address general questions debated in the scholarly community.",article,14000,
