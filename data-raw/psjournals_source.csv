16,Socio-Economic Review,16,36,51,2003,Oxford University Press,https://academic.oup.com/ser,"Originating in the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics (SASE), Socio-Economic Review (SER) is part of a broader movement in the social sciences for the rediscovery of the socio-political foundations of the economy. Devoted to the advancement of socio-economics, it deals with the analytical, political and moral questions arising at the intersection between economy and society. Articles in SER explore how the economy is or should be governed by social relations, institutional rules, political decisions, and cultural values. They also consider how the economy in turn affects the society of which it is part, for example by breaking up old institutional forms and giving rise to new ones. The domain of the journal is deliberately broadly conceived, so new variations to its general theme may be discovered and editors can learn from the papers that readers submit. To enhance international dialogue, Socio-Economic Review accepts the submission of translated articles that are simultaneously published in a language other than English. In pursuit of its program, SER is eager to promote interdisciplinary dialogue between sociology, economics, political science and moral philosophy, through both empirical and theoretical work. Empirical papers may be qualitative as well as quantitative, and theoretical papers will not be confined to deductive model-building. Papers suggestive of more generalizable insights into the economy as a domain of social action will be preferred over narrowly specialized work. While firmly committed to the highest standards of scholarly excellence, Socio-Economic Review encourages discussion of the practical and ethical dimensions of economic action, with the intention to contribute to both the advancement of social science and the building of a good economy in a good society.",1,article,Article,,10000,words,11/05/2020

It responds to the need for more productive collaboration among sociologists, international relations specialists and sociopolitical theorists. IPS offers a meeting place for scholars from all over the world, and strongly encourages transdisciplinary and critical analyses of contemporary global phenomena. Issues of particular concern for IPS are those challenges arising from contemporary transformations of social, political, and global orders, especially given that many approaches to international relations reproduce statist forms that marginalize and silence multiple social processes. IPS draws especially on traditions of historical, legal, cultural, economic and political sociology that address global orders and changes, as well as on the cognate fields of socio-political theory, anthropology and human geography. It is committed to theoretical innovation, the decentering of dominant modes of knowledge production and novel approaches to empirical research. Most importantly, IPS is committed to the geographical and cultural diversification of research beyond the usual circuits of European and North-American scholarship. In order to help broaden the community engaging in international studies, the journal will facilitate the submission of articles in languages other than English. We are interested in submissions that take our understanding of international, transnational and global phenomena out of the comfort zone of familiar approaches. Currently we are particularly interested in receiving papers on new developments in postcolonial and decolonial approaches, questions of transversal citizenship, innovative analyses of gender relations, the international re-politicisation of inequality, new debates on the Anthropocene, innovative approaches to critical thinking and methods, re-imaginations of security, and critical engagements with practice theory.

IT welcomes scholarship that uses evidence from the real world to advance theoretical arguments. However, IT is intended as a forum where scholars can develop theoretical arguments in depth without an expectation of extensive empirical analysis. IT s over-arching goal is to promote communication and engagement across theoretical and disciplinary traditions. IT puts a premium on contributors  ability to reach as broad an audience as possible, both in the questions they engage and in their accessibility to other approaches. This might be done by addressing problems that can only be understood by combining multiple disciplinary discourses, like institutional design, or practical ethics; or by addressing phenomena that have broad ramifications, like civilizing processes in world politics, or the evolution of environmental norms. IT is also open to work that remains within one scholarly tradition, although in that case authors must make clear the horizon of their arguments in relation to other theoretical approaches.

It is not constrained by disciplinary boundaries, and welcomes submissions that bring marginalized and misunderstood aspects of contemporary politics into focus and into the academic mainstream. While the journal does not have a book review section, it publishes lengthy review articles that are both theoretically-rich and empirically informed.

CEP defines its scope broadly to include the comparative politics and political economy of the whole of contemporary Europe within and beyond the European Union, the processes of European integration and enlargement and the place of Europe and European states within international/global political and economic dynamics. As the most regionally integrated political and economic space within the global system, Europe presents a particular opportunity to political scientists to explore the dynamic relationship between transnational, international and domestic processes and practices. The editors welcome original theoretical, empirical and theoretically-informed pieces which deal with these relationships. Such issues pose awkward questions about the limitations of existing disciplinary perspectives and theoretical conventions, requiring theoretical and methodological innovation and an ability to develop genuinely interdisciplinary approaches. CEP aims to publish exceptional work prepared to rise to this challenge. The journal is rigorously peer-reviewed. It neither reflects nor represents any particular school or approach, nor does it restrict itself to particular methodologies or theoretical perspectives. Rather, whilst promoting interdisciplinarity and a greater dialogue between the various sub-disciplines of European political analysis, Comparative European Politics publishes the best and most original work in the field. It publishes substantial articles marking either core empirical developments, theoretical innovation or, preferably, both. The journal particularly encourages pieces which seek to develop the link between substantive empirical investigations and theoretical elaboration and those which transcend the artificial separation of domestic, comparative and international analysis. The editors publish a limited number of debate pieces and review articles related to issues of contemporary theoretical and empirical controversy.

While recognising the validity and the importance of research into specific aspects of British politics, the journal takes it to be a guiding principle that such research is more useful, and indeed meaningful, if it is related to the field of British politics in a broader and fuller sense. The scope of the journal will therefore be broad, incorporating a range of research papers and review articles from all theoretical perspectives, and on all aspects of British politics, including policy developments, institutional change and political behaviour. Priority will, however, be given to contributions which link contemporary developments in British politics to theoretical and/or historical analyses. The aim is as much to encourage the development of empirical research that is theoretically rigorous and informed, as it is to encourage the empirical application of theoretical work (or at least to encourage theorists to explicitly signify how their work could be applied in an empirical manner).",1,article,Article,,9000,words,11/05/2020

Founded by the Carl Vinson Institute of Government of the University of Georgia, State and Local Government Review is the official journal of the Section on Intergovernmental Administration and Management (SIAM) of the American Society for Public Administration.

Like the Vinson Institute, SIAM has an interest not only in state and local government, but also in the effective interaction among public officials in a federal system. It seeks to foster the dissemination of information about research and experience that contributes to the understanding and improvement of the intergovernmental system. The Review welcomes manuscripts that focus on state and local governments and those that explore the intergovernmental dimensions of public-sector activity. The journal is comprised of four sections: General Interest (research articles), Research Notes (shorter research pieces), Reviews & Essays (for both book reviews, reviews of literature and essays), and Governance Matters (more practitioner-focused pieces).",1,article,Article,20,30,pages,11/05/2020

The journal is a forum for those engaged in the pursuit of generating new knowledge and analyses of Indian politics based on original research. By way of making such a knowledge and analyses accessible to the public, it cater to the needs of a large number of social and political scientists engaged in teaching and research at educational and research institutions in India and abroad. SIP expects readership mainly from academics and students (both post-graduate and research level) in higher education institutions and research institutes in India and abroad. We also expect a few interested journalists, NGO functionaries, political analysts and commentators and policy makers to read the journal. The journal caters to the need of researchers and students in Political Science, and within political science, its emphasis will be on Indian politics, state politics in India, political thinking in India and comparative politics with India/global South as the focus.",3,book_review,Book Review (Multiple),,3000,words,11/05/2020

The initial goal was to develop, and project globally, a uniquely Central European take on unfolding international and security issues. This entailed an initial  out-reach  programme to attract scholars from throughout the four Central European states - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic - to participate in the journal as authors and members of the Editorial and (then) Advisory Boards. By the time of the first issue however, it became clear that CEJISS was also capable of acting as a platform for non-Central European scholars to present their academic research to a more regionalised audience.

The journal analyses legislatures actors and activities, including their internal and external relations, from a theoretical, procedural, or practical point of view. The editors cultivate a strongly international author base and encourage contributions from the various fields of the legal and social sciences, thus seeking to offer a remedy to the specialization within and estrangement between these disciplines as well as to the distance between legislative theory and parliamentary practice. Until recently, legislative issues, parliamentary procedure, and practice were exclusively the purview of national legislation and jurisdiction and were, therefore, issues for primarily domestic scholarship. However, a kind of parliamentary ius gentium or ius commune is evolving: Parliamentary activities are increasingly observed by international actors and repeatedly reviewed by international forums. Parliamentary issues are no longer matters of one institution or nation. There are points of contact between institutions and nations, and learning from one another is possible (e.g., regarding constitution and state building). Supranational parliaments (including the European Parliament) are gradually becoming important actors in world politics and policies. The International Journal of Parliamentary Studies invites scholars of all levels of seniority and types of experience, from PhD students to professors and practitioners in parliamentary administrations, to submit papers on parliamentary issues, such as parliamentary functions, procedures, practice, the universal concepts of parliament (e.g., ministerial accountability, scrutiny, public engagement, separation of powers), democratic representation and elections, legislation, and constitutions.",7,comment,Forum,,2000,words,08/09/2020
308,European Policy Analysis,,,,2015,Wiley,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/23806567,"The European Policy Analysis (EPA) journal is devoted to the publication of original contributions, reviews, forum contributions, and book advertisements of contemporary work in the field of policy process research with a focus on European public policy. A focus on Europe thereby means both to assess the traveling capacity of international perspectives to European cases and to make European perspectives accessible and applicable to international cases. In doing so, the journal also encourages comparative contributions and is open to a variety of theoretical and empirical approaches. As part of the family of Policy Studies Organization (PSO) journals, EPA is committed to publications of highest quality and accepts a variety of manuscript types. Apart from forum contributions and book advertisements, all submissions are subject to rigorous double-blind peer review. EPA invites previously unpublished papers and quality articles that fall within its scope. It is especially interested in articles that present the European state-of-the-art for major theoretical or practical concepts of policy analysis such as institutions, policy learning, evaluation, policy advice, advocacy coalition framework in the European context, multiple streams approach in the European context, punctuated equilibrium theory in the European context, programmatic actors, actor-centered institutionalism, multi-level policy-making in the European context and other similar contributions. We also invite overviews on regional perspectives on public policy in Europe ranging from country reports (e.g. policy analysis in France, policy analysis in Russia, policy analysis in Slovenia) to regional ones (e.g., policy analysis in the Baltic countries) and similar contributions.",1,article,Article,4000,8000,words,08/09/2020

It seeks to publish innovative research on the intersections between environmental and security issues, and to inspire debates by decision makers and practitioners. All research published in the journal will engage with and advance existing academic debates on the topic, either through presenting novel empirical findings, through theoretical elaboration, or through insights from practitioners.

Environment and Security is open to a wide range of topics. We understand the environment to comprise (i) natural resources used by or (potentially) useful to humans, (ii) the ecosystem services sustaining these resources, and (iii) the components of the earth system into which these resources and services are embedded (e.g., climate system, biosphere). We understand security in a wide sense, encompassing international security, national security, human security, ontological security, and securitization, among others, including a wide range of referent objects. The journal will address both violent/armed conflicts as well as social conflicts, incorporating concepts of both positive and negative peace. All contributions clearly speak to current theoretical and/or empirical debates about the environment-security nexus.

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

Resource scarcity and environmental change as drivers of conflict
Climate change, extreme events, and conflict
Conflict financing through natural resources
Environmental dimensions of peacekeeping, peacemaking, and peacebuilding
Environmental conflict resolution and diplomacy
Cooperative potential of shared environmental interests
Environmental impacts of armed conflict
Gender dimensions of environment-security intersections
Role of the environment for economic development and human security
Environmental justice, human security, and social conflicts
Disasters, disaster risk reduction, peace, and conflict
Political ecologies of extraction and resource grabbing
Environmental and climate-related migration
Violence against environmental activists

319,Journal of Pacifism and Nonviolence,,,,2023,Brill,https://brill.com/view/journals/jpn/jpn-overview.xml,"The Journal of Pacifism and Nonviolence aims to:

1. analyse and critique the considerable range of pacifist positions (political, ethical, religious, etc.) and approaches to nonviolence in both theory and practice, reflect on historical and more recent case studies (small- or large-scale), reflect on influential activists and social movements, and compare the effectiveness of violence and nonviolence as well as the effectiveness of the huge variety of tactics of nonviolent dissent;
2. interrogate central accusations against pacifism: that it reinforces the status quo; that it is predominantly white and middle class; that it cannot be sustained in the most challenging scenarios; that it is philosophically incoherent or morally impoverished, etc.;
3. discuss tensions between pacifism (as an ethical position) and nonviolence (as a form of political action) and consider criticisms of both;
4. consider, compare, and discuss theories and practices of pacifism and nonviolence (including those that have emerged in the Global South and/or that may employ vocabularies different from those employed in the Global North) and/or that may find expression through art/aesthetics;
5. study the multiple (political, social, economic, psychological, cultural, philosophical, etc.) direct and indirect consequences of violence and militarism and of nonviolent action and pacifism;
6. examine the place of violence and nonviolence in the history of political thought, in the arguments of core thinkers (e.g., Hobbes, Kant, Tolstoy, Gandhi, Schmidt, Arendt, Bourdieu, Butler), in those of overlooked or marginalised thinkers, as well as in political ideologies (e.g., anarchism, fascism, liberalism, feminism), in some of their principal concepts (e.g., masculinity, democracy, sovereignty, utopia, prefiguration, colonialism), and in relation to themes examined in cognate scholarship (e.g., technology, emotions, temporality, identity);
7. analyse the relationship between nonviolence/violence and gender, race, and other social identities; for example, how racism and patriarchy may be tied to the legitimation of violence and how racial and gender identities, norms, and/or privilege intersect with the practice and strategy of nonviolent action;
8. explore and debate the diverse religious/spiritual roots of pacifism and nonviolence past and present: Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Indigenous, etc.;
9. debate the role of violence in popular culture past and present, the often lukewarm reception of pacifist ideas by the broader public, and the interests these serve;
10. assess the potential for not only nonviolent resistance but also nonviolent policies of governance (such as in public order maintenance, policing, crime management, and counterterrorism), nonviolent practices of protection (such as unarmed civilian protection and zones of peace), and practical proposals to move away from institutions that rely on violence (such as trans-armament, demilitarisation, and nonviolent civilian-based defence);
11. re-examine predominant assumptions in international relations theory and practice about terrorism, the international order, just war, etc.;
12. develop more precise conceptualisations of violence and nonviolence, reflecting on the exact nature of violence (e.g., institutional violence, property damage, racism, gendered constructs) and on the point at which direct action becomes violent;
13. identify and debate methodological challenges in researching pacifism and nonviolence, articulate pacifist critiques to research ethics, and reflect on pedagogies of pacifism and nonviolence.

The Journal of Pacifism and Nonviolence is committed to methodological pluralism and welcomes research employing either theoretical or empirical methods. It is rooted in politics and international relations (including security studies, social movements studies, political theory, peace studies, terrorism studies, strategic studies, and resistance studies) and is open to contributions grounded, for example, in historiography, sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, geography, philosophy, and religious studies.",1,article,Research Article,,10000,words,17/11/2022

Identifies and analyzes the forces, funding, strategies, and tactics that help determine policy change
Spans disciplines to offer broad and deep examination of trends in advocacy
This journal records and analyzes the multitude of ways that advocacy by groups, movements and lobbying professionals can work to influence policy. It also provides a focal point for significant current discussions about how these specialized interests are mobilized and maintained.
Interest Groups & Advocacy ranges widely across the international landscape of politics and society, identifying the forces, strategies, and tactics that determine policy change. The articles published here reflect a diversity of methodologies. The coverage includes studies that address theoretical issues, reports rigorous empirical work, and presents insight on change agents, their behavior and their impact.
In a field long dominated by American political science, the journal reflects the widening geographical footprint of advocacy. Lobbyists have proliferated, and advocacy spending has increased in Europe, as well as in states, provinces and localities around the world. The journal synthesizes this territorial expansion with broadened interest in the number and type of advocacy organizations. Also noted is the changing nature of advocates, including multi-national corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and social movements - so divergent from textbook stereotypes of interest groups - that seek to influence public policies.
Although the journal is anchored within political science, it publishes research based in such other disciplines as economics, sociology, law, and history. Also covered are social movement scholarship and public affairs, which form important components of the process of competitive advocacy that today often functions as a proxy for democratic contestation.
